#Processes
These are what Chemical Engineers deal with almost all the time.
They are any operation that causes a physical or chemical change of a substance or mixture of substances.

#Chemical Engineering Calculations

##Units and Conversion

_2.1, 2.2, 2.3_

Dimension: Measurable Properties (*length, mass*)

Units: Means to Express Dimension(*m, lbm*)

###Unit Systems
*Système Internationale (SI)* is dominant in science, and gaining dominance in trades/commerce. Only the US, Liberia and Myanmar are not using it. It is based on the metre (m), kilogram (kg), and second (s).

The *CGS System* is similar to *SI*, but is based on the centimetre (cm), gram (g), and second (s).

*American Engineering System of Units (AE)* is based on the foot (ft), pound mass (lbm), and second (s).

A system of units must contain base (fundamental) units from which all of the others can be derived.  The 7 fundamental dimensions are:

| Dimension | SI unit  | SI abbr | AE unit    | AE abbr |
|-----------+
| Mass      | kilogram | kg      | pound mass | lbm     |
|-----------+
| Length    | metre    | m       | foot       | ft      |
|-----------+
|Time       | second   | s       | second     | s       |
|-----------+
| Amount    | mole     | mol     | pound-mole | lbmol   |
|-----------+
| Temperature | Kelvin | K       | Rankine    | R       |
|-----------+
| Electric Current | Ampere | A  | Ampere     | A       |
|-----------+
| Light Intensity | Candela | cd |   Candela  | cd      |


| Prefix | Abbreviation | Factor |
|:------:|:------------:|:------:|
| Exa | E | $$10^18$$ |

| Peta | P | $$10^15$$ |

| Tera  | T  | $$10^12$$ |

###Derived units: a combination of base units

Acceleration: $$\frac{m}{s^2}$$

Force: $$\frac{kg*m}{s^2} =$$ Newton (N)

Pressure: $$\frac{kg}{m*s^2} =$$ Pascal (Pa)

*A number without units is meaningless except as a coefficient or ratio.*

###Unit Conversion

Unit Conversion is the process used to express a dimension measure given in one unit system in terms of another unit system. Conversion factors are used to make the change.



**Example: Purchase of a Car**
{: .example}

Fuel Cost = $1.25/L

|| Car 1     | Car 2      |
|---
| Purchase Price   | $13000    | $16600     |
|---
| Fuel Consumption | 30 mi/gal | 6L / 100km |

Car 1:

| 1 gal | 1000 L     | 1 mi   | 0.0787 L |
|---
| 30 mi | 264.17 gal | 1.6 km | km       |
    
Total Cost = 13000[$] + $1.25[1/L]*0.0787[L/km]*x[km]</p>
    
Car 2:
| 6 L    | 0.06 L |
| 100 km | km     |
    
Total Cost = 16600[$] + 1.25[$/L]*0.06[L/km]*x[km]

$13000 + 1.25[$/L]*0.0787[L/km]*x[km] = $16600 + $1.25[1/L]*0.06[L/km]*x[km]
x = 160 000 [km]

Car 2 is less expensive if you drive over 160,000 km.


###Temperature Conversion

####Absolute Temperature (measured temperature)

-273.15°C = 0k = -459.67°F = 0°R

0°C = 273.15k = 32°F = 491.67°R

T(k) = T(°C) + 273.15

T(°F) = 1.8*T(°C)+32

T(°R) = 1.8*T(k)

####Temperature Interval (difference of temperature)

1°C = 1k = 1.8°F = 1.8°R

**Example: Convert gas constant from $$\frac{m^3*Pa}{mol*k}$$ to $$\frac{ft^3*atm}{lbmol*°R}**
{: .example}

| $$8.314 m^3*Pa$$ | $$3.2808^3 ft^3$$ | 1 atm               | 453.6 mol | 1 k   | $$0.7302 ft^3*atm |
|--
| mol*k            | $$m^3             | $$1.01325*10^5 Pa$$ | 1 lbmol   | 1.8°R | $$lbmol*°R$$ |


##Significant Figures
Significant figures area  way of representing the precision of your data or measurements. 13°C in  a weather forecast indicates an expected temperature between 12.5°C and 13.5°C.

Rules for calculations:

    *Addition/Subtraction: use the precision of the least precise value  
     Ex. 25.4 + 3.719 = 29.1
    *Multiplication/Division: keep the number of digits as in the shortest value  
     Ex. 8.314*25.2 = 210


##Force and Weight

###Force

From Newton's Law: $$F = m*a$$
