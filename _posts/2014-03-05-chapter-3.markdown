<h1>Processes and Process Variables</h1>
<h2>Mass and Volume</h2>
<p>Mass and Volume are two important properties which are related through a number of measures:</p>
<p>Density: Mass per unit Volume.</p>
<p>Specific Volume: Volume per unit Mass.</p>
<p>Specific Gravity: Ratio of the density of the substance to the density of a reference substance at given conditions.  The most common reference is water at 4Â°C (1.00 g/cm<sup>3</sup>)</p>
<p>Temperature and Pressure generally have only a small effect on the density of solids and liquids.</p>
